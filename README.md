Your Book Recommendation System project involves suggesting books to users based on their preferences using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes user behavior, ratings, and book metadata to provide personalized recommendations. It likely employs collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and a user-friendly interface to display recommendations.
